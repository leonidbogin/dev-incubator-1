Technical task:
1) Create necessary project based on ASP.NET MVC or ASP.NET Web API in Visual Studio.
2) Add models, controllers.
3) Add actions to controllers, add views, make up html.
4) Add javascript library, draw chart.
5) Add validation on the server side.
6) Add styles, validation on the client side.
Please note, you should implement all this steps using just obvious data structure without any
database, DO NOT do next tasks, if you have uncompleted the previous tasks.
7) Add in a project database (MS SQL Server) with necessary tables, Entity Framework ORM or
Dapper.
8) Application must be able to cache all the computations and to save them in local database.
9) Rewrite front-end with React or Angular.
10) Create it responsive and adaptive.
```
```
The project is almost complete, except for "9) Rewrite front-end with React or Angular." 
(There is not enough time to study a new technology, perhaps I will finish it later.)
```

The local database and code first allow to run out of the box.
